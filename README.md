GitHub PR Bot is an automated tool that receives new PR review comments via a GitHub webhook connected to its Web API post endpoint. It then writes a comment on the PR with suggested code solution, making it easier for developers to quickly iterate and optimize their code. In addition, it also checks whether all pull requests have been merged or not, ensuring that the project stays organized and up-to-date.

GitHub Bot is a really cool automated tool that helps streamline the process of creating pull requests. It automatically checks your code for errors and provides feedback about any potential issues. With its powerful features and easy-to-understand interface, GitHub Bot helps developers save time and maximize their productivity.
